Quantum computing class - 4 (demo project)
This project implements the SWAP test, a quantum algorithm used to measure the similarity between two quantum states. 
It utilizes a single qubit to determine the inner product of the states via probabilistic measurement, providing a critical operation for quantum information processing.
